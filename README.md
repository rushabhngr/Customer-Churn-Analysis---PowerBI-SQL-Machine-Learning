# Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Project (Power BI + SQL + Machine Learning)

This project is an end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis pipeline built using **SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI**.  
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn and generate insights to help reduce churn and improve retention.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze historical customer data to understand churn patterns
- Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to churn
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn

---

##  Dataset

- Customer demographics
- Subscription & service details
- Contract, tenure, and billing information
- Churn label (Yes/No)

*(Dataset used for learning purposes based on the tutorial.)*

---

##  Tech Stack

- **SQL** – Data extraction, filtering, and aggregation  
- **Python / Machine Learning** – Model building (Logistic Regression / other classifier), feature engineering  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard, KPIs, churn visuals  
- **Excel/CSV** – Base data (if applicable)

---

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction (SQL)**
   - Imported raw churn data into SQL
   - Cleaned, filtered, and aggregated data using SQL queries
   - Prepared final dataset for modeling and reporting

2. **Data Preprocessing & Machine Learning**
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
   - Split data into train and test sets
   - Trained a classification model to predict churn
   - Evaluated model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

3. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Connected processed dataset to Power BI
   - Built KPIs and visuals:
     - Overall churn rate
     - Churn by tenure, contract type, and payment method
     - High-risk customer segments
   - Designed an interactive dashboard for non-technical users

---

##  Key Insights (Examples)

- Higher churn observed in customers with **month-to-month contracts**
- Customers with **short tenure** and **electronic billing** are more likely to churn
- Certain customer segments respond better to long-term plans and discounts

*(Insights may vary slightly depending on the final dataset and filters.)*
